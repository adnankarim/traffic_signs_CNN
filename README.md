# Project Overview

In this project, I will performed the traffic signs classification using the data provided by International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN) in 2011 for a competition (available in public domain) and deep learning techniques. Traffic signs classification is an important task in self-driving cars. Thus, I have built a deep learning model to classify the German traffic signs to one of the 43 classes.

## Language,tools, Libraries and Framework Used

* Python 3.0 +

* Jupyter notebook

* Tensorflow 2.0 +

* NumPy

* MatplotLib

* Pickle

* skLearn or scilitlearn



## TRAINING PROCESS

Used the GPU for training which supports cuda and tuned the hyperparameters accordingly.


## What did I do?
Downloaded the data using python script in jupyter notebook.

The process used for this project can be summarized using the following steps:

1. Get data from link.
2. Separate all datasets and visualize.
3. Preprocess Dataset.
4. Define LeNetâ€™s Model..
6. Train and keep an eye on validation losses and accuracy.
7. Measure Test Accuracy.
8. Finally predict for unseen test data.
